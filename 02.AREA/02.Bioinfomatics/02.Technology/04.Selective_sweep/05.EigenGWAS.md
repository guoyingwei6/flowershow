## Introduction

EigenGWAS is a method used in population genetics to identify loci under selection. It operates on a principle similar to that of a genome-wide association study (GWAS) but uses eigenvectors derived from genomic data as response variables. These eigenvectors are typically obtained from methods such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which summarize the main patterns of genetic variation across individuals in a study.

In EigenGWAS, each genetic marker (e.g., a single nucleotide polymorphism or SNP) is regressed against an eigenvector. This approach allows researchers to determine if any particular loci are statistically associated with the primary axes of genetic variation, which may reflect underlying processes such as selection or population structure.

This method is particularly useful for identifying loci that differ in allele frequency across gradients of ancestry or other forms of population structure, making it an effective tool in ecological and evolutionary genomics to detect natural or artificial selection without the need for clearly defined sub-populations.

We utilized GEAR v0.919 [24] with default parameters to perform EigenGWAS analysis on South China and North China indigenous pigs, aiming to screen for selection signals of population differentiation. First, we extracted the first principal component information from three groups: “South China indigenous pigs vs. Asian wild boars”, “North China indigenous pigs vs. Asian wild boars”, and “South vs. North China indigenous pigs” as the input phenotype. We then conducted calculations for each chromosome file and merged the results from individual chromosomes to achieve genome-wide site analysis results. To enhance the statistical power of this selection signature analysis, we utilized GC (Genetic Correction)adjusted P values (PGC) as the indicator for significant loci. We applied the Bonferroni correction method, using “0.05 / total number of loci” as the significance threshold.  (10.1186/s12864-024-11119-y)
